       <h2> Testing our code</h2>
       <p>
        We tested our code with a few different accessibility tools.
       </p>



       <h2> Why do we test for accessiblility? </h2> 
       <p>
        Testing the code for accessiblility is important because it 
        ensures that anyone, including disabled people, can use our application.
