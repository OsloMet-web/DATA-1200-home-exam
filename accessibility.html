        <h1>Accessibility and Universal Design</h1>

        <h2> A world of universal design </h2> 
       <p>
        Universal design is a necessity which brings more unity and equity to our diversified world. 
        Devices are continously becoming more and more universally available, 
        ensuring that anyone, regardless of disabilities, can benefit from them. 
       </p>


       <h3> Specific coding choices</h3>
       <p>
        Our topical page <a href="topical.html">"5 ways to thrive when in university"</a> contains styling properties that takes accessibility into consideration in multiple ways. 
       
        
        <ul class="unordered-list"> <!-- unordered list-->
            <li>Scaling:</li>
            <li>Colors: Proper contrast so that people with impaired vision can wiew the page without strain, 
                and use of some elements ..bla bla bla.. </li>
            
            <li>Focus state: Possibly using offset property so the text is more clear.</li>
            <li>Text size: Helps with readability for visually impaired users.</li>
            <li>Link states: Having different link states can help a range of people.
                <ul>
                    <li> Hover states can help those with muscle movement issues to know when to click.</li>
                    <li>Focus links for those who use keyboards to know what link they are activating.</li>
                    <li>Visited states for those with short term memory loss to know what pages they already have seen.</li>
                </ul>
            <li> Hover state: When the user hovers over the page, bold font or underlines will appear to show the selected links.
                This can be beneficial for those with motor issues and vision impairment.</li>
            <li> Images: Description of images.</li>
            <li>Underline:</li>

        </ul>  
    
        </p>
       

       <h3>Accessibility results</h3>
       <p class="results">
        As previously mentioned, testing the code for accessibility
        ensures that anyone, including disabled people, can browse our website.
        We chose to test our code using the WAVE evaluation tool extension, 
        because it is known as one of the most thorough accessibility checking engines. 
        WAVE has a variation of icons which collectively shows the accessibility of the page.
        
        
        <ul class="unordered-list-2">
            <li><img src="assets/images/errors.png"> Errors:</li>
            <li class="contrast-errors"><img src="assets/images/contrasterrors.png"> Contrast Errors:</li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/alerts.png"> Alerts:</li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/features.png"> Features:</li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/structuralelements.png"> Structural elements:</li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/aria.png"> Aria:</li>
        </ul> 

        
        

        - We chose to download the extension and it showed errors which we tried to correct...bla bla 
        
       </p>
        


        <div class="">

        /*Legger inn bilde her, og kanskje image float effekt p√• styling*/

        </div>
    <p>
        Legger til bildeskrift.
        As the image above shows, the results were complying with the standards for accessibility. Although we had some difficulties regarding bla bla.
        Hvordan var accessibility resultater? Var det noen feil?
