        <h2> A world of universal design </h2> 
       <p>

        ensuring that anyone, regardless of disabilities, can benefit from them.

       <h3> Specific coding choices</h3>
       <p>
        Our topical page <a href="topical.html">"5 ways to thrive when in university"</a> contain semantic elements that takes accessibility into consideration in multiple ways. 
        <ul>

                and use of some elements ..bla bla bla.. </li>
            <br>

        </p>
       

       <h3> Testing for accessibility</h3>
       <p>
        Testing the code for accessibility is important because it 
        ensures that anyone, including disabled people, can browse our website.
        We tested our code using the WAVE evaluation tool, 
        because it is known as one of the most thorough accessibility checking tools.
