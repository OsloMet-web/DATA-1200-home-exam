        <h2> A world of universal design </h2> 
       <p>
        Universal design is a necessity which brings more unity and equity to our diversified world. 
        Devices are continously becoming more and more universally available, 
        ensuring that anyone, regardless of disabilities, can benefit from them.

       <p>
        Our topical page -link- contain semantic elements that takes accessibility into consideration in multiple ways. 
        Scaling:
        Colors: Proper contrast so that people with impaired vision can wiew the page without strain, 
        and use of some elements ..bla bla bla.. 
        Focus state: Possibly using offset property so the text is more clear.
        Text size: Helps with readability for visually impaired users.
        Link states: Active or inactive.
        Hover state: When the user hovers over the page, bold font or underlines will appear to show the selected links. 
        This can be beneficial for those with motor issues and vision impairment.

       <h2> Testing for accessibility</h2>
       <p>
        Testing the code for accessibility is important because it 
        ensures that anyone, including disabled people, can browse our website.
        We tested our code using the WAVE evaluation tool, 
        because it is one of the most thorough accessibility checking tools.
