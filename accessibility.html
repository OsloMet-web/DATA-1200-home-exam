        <h1>Accessibility and Universal Design</h1>

        <h2> A world of universal design </h2> 
       <p>
        Universal design is a necessity which brings more unity and equity to our diversified world. 
        Devices are continously becoming more and more universally available, 
        ensuring that anyone, regardless of disabilities, can benefit from them. 
         Today most websites and digital platforms are designed with various accessibility features, 
        such as text-to-speech for those with reading issues or visual impairment, speech recognition for limited mobility,
        alternative text for images, and keyboard shortcuts.
       </p>

       <h3> Specific coding choices</h3>
       <p>
        All our pages contains styling properties that takes accessibility into consideration in multiple ways.       
        <ul class="unordered-list"> <!-- unordered list-->
            <li>
                <b>Structure:</b>
                <br>
                The pages were designed to have a header, footer and main content seperated out in a structured manner.
                <br>
                Also made sure to start and end the tags accordingly during development.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Clear content:</b>
                <br>
                The pages were designed so that the content is clear and can be conveyed through images and short texts with it.
            </li>
            <li>             
                <b>Scaling:</b>
                 <br>
                 In order for the website to scale according to viewing window size and client (pc or mobile), standard scaling design practices were tried to be used.
                 <br>
                 Usage of percentages instead of px was preferred wherever possible. 
                 <br>
                Usage of em or rem instead of px.
                <br>
                Designing the sites header footer and content with scaling in mind.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Colors and Contrast ratio:</b>
                <br>                
                The pages and colors chosen were designed so the colors have proper contrast that even people with impaired vision can view the page without strain.
                <br>
                To make it simple the background of the main content was chosen to white or light in color with the texts mostly being in black. 
                <br>
                In <a href="topical.html">Tips</a> pages which followed a different style, the colors followed were consistent with the header and footer to keep color contrast as consistent and pleasant as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Focus state:</b>
                <br> 
                The page considered having focus states when users hover over images or topics to make it clear the area which is read or focused.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Text size:</b>
                <br>
                The pages were designed so that text sizes of all important headings and text were kept large and readable enough to help with readability for visually impaired users.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Images and alternative texts:</b>
                <br>
                 All pages designed to provide alternative text for images, along with the titles                
            <li>
                <b>Hover state:</b>
                <br>
                Pages designed so that when the user hovers over the page, bold font or underlines will appear to show the selected links.
                This can be beneficial for those with motor issues and vision impairment.
            </li>                       

        </ul>  
    
        </p>      

       <h3>Accessibility results</h3>
       <p>
        To test the accessibility of the pages <b>WAVE</b> web accessibility evaluation tool was used, because it is known as one of the most thorough accessibility checking engines.
        We decided to download the chrome extension of WAVE and used it for automatic testing of accesibility of the site pages.
       </p>
      

        <p class="access-results">
            WAVE has a variation of labels which collectively shows the accessibility of the page:             
            <ul class="unordered-list-2">
                <li class="errors"><img src="assets/images/errors.png" alt="errors"><b>Errors:</b> For example missing alternative texts </li>
                 <li class="contrast-errors"><img src="assets/images/contrasterrors.png" alt="contrast errors"><b>Contrast Errors:</b> For example poor contrast between text and background color. </li>
                 <li class="alerts"><img src="assets/images/alerts.png" alt="alerts"> <b>Alerts:</b> For example skipped heading levels and redundant links.</li>
                 <li><img src="assets/images/features.png" alt="features"><b>Features:</b> For example empty alternative texts, linked images with alternative texts, figures and language.</li>
                 <li><img src="assets/images/structuralelements.png" alt="structural elements"><b>Structural Elements:</b> For example different heading levels, lists, main content, navigation, headers and footers.</li>
                 <li><img src="assets/images/aria.png" alt="aria"><b>Aria:</b> A label that provides extra information on the purpose of certain elements, benefiting assistive technology like screen readers.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
 

       <p>
        The web accessibility of the pages were tested using WAVE as shown below:
        <br>
        (Note: Screenshots shown below were taken while the pages still had errors in them to demonstrate the testing process; they are all corrected now.) 
       <br>

        <ul class="unordered-list"> <!-- unordered list-->
            <li>
                <b>Summary of the results:</b>
                <br>
                All errors and alerts were immediately addressed.
                <br>
                There were no contrast errors found. Features and structural elements were found to be as per universal standards as well.
                <br>

            <li>
                <b>Details of the results:</b>
                <br>
                Details of the results were checked.

            <li>
                <b>Structural Elements:</b>
                <br>
                Checked the detailed structural elements of each page to see if all pages are well structured and as per the design standards.
                <br>
                <img class="wave-image" src="assets/images/wavestructure.jpg" alt="Wave Structure">

            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Contrast Ratio:</b>
                <br>
                The constrast ratio provides the ratio of contrast on average of the page and tells if it has passed WCAG AA and AAA standards.
