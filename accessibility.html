        <h1>Accessibility and Universal Design</h1>

        <h2> A world of universal design </h2> 
       <p>
        Universal design is a necessity which brings more unity and equity to our diversified world. 
        Devices are continously becoming more and more universally available, 
        ensuring that anyone, regardless of disabilities, can benefit from them. 
       </p>

       <h3> Specific coding choices</h3>
       <p>
        All our pages contains styling properties that takes accessibility into consideration in multiple ways.       
        <ul class="unordered-list"> <!-- unordered list-->

                <b>Well Structured:</b>
                <br>
                The pages were designed so it has a well structure design with Header, footer, main content seperated out in a structured manner.
                <br>
                Also made sure to start and end the tags accordingly during development.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Clear content:</b>
                <br>
                The pages were designed so that the content is clear and can be conveyed through images and short texts with it.
            </li>
            <li>             
                <b>Scaling:</b>
                 <br>
                 In order for the website to scale according to viewing window size and client (pc or mobile), standard scaling design practices were tried to be used.
                 <br>
                 Usage of percentages instead of px was preferred wherever possible. 
                 <br>
                Usage of em or rem instead of px.
                <br>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Colors and Contrast ratio:</b>
                <br>                
                The pages and colors chosen were designed so the colors have proper contrast that even people with impaired vision can view the page without strain.
                <br>
                To make it simple the background of the main content was chosen to white or light in color with the texts mostly being in black. 
                <br>
                In <a href="topical.html">Tips</a> pages which followed a different style, the colors followed were consistent with the header and footer to keep color contrast as consistent and pleasant as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Focus state:</b>
                <br>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Text size:</b>
                <br>
                The pages were designed so that text sizes of all important headings and text were kept large and readable enough to help with readability for visually impaired users.
            </li>

       <h3>Accessibility results</h3>
       <p>
        To Test the accessibility of the pages <b>WAVE</b>, web accessibility evaluation tool was used, because it is known as one of the most thorough accessibility checking engines.
